                    "In my maths masters I fell in love with Neural Networks since from beginning I saw the possibility to connect both numerical maths and Neural Networks to each other. It turned out that one can interpret Neural Networks (RNNs and CNNs) as a differential equation, like information propagation, this was mindblowing. I read papers, did extensively many ml courses at 3 Universities in Berlin: HU,TU, FU in Machine Learning (3x), Deep Learning (3x), visiting Statistics courses (3x), after this I was able to understand every advanced Mathematics related with machine learning and Mathematics. I thought, thats it, I am a lucky person who borned in the right time.\nThe culmination of my maths masters was my master's thesis. It dealed as I said wiht the connection of AI with numerical maths, which is in my opinion a huge step to understand and control the AI algorithms, making them from black box into white box, making them robust and trustful e.g. in the autonomouse systems. In my masters thesis I discovered a new type of Neural Networks, which are promising to be much more stable and trustful than the current ones, this was confirmed in my masters thesis numerical examples. My supervisors were very happy with this result and they told me this opens a complete new directoin in the Mathematics of the AI. Now I am in cooperation with my student collegues and developing the paper on this Ideas. Hopefully you understand enough applied maths stuff to be able to read this very exited paper, stay up to dated when I upload it here!",

The study exceeded my expectaions. \nOn the first day I met my bodies with them I am hanging out till today, friends with them you can go til to the end of the world.\nPhysics changed dramatically my way of looking at things. Suddenly the world started not to be magic but the magic was to explain the wolrd with beautiful and simple mathematical equations. That is why I wanted to became a theoretical physicist for which one needs great mathematical knowledge. Thats why I started to study Mathematics parallel to physics. I believed into myself it was possible to study both maths and physics paralelly since I mastered physics much better and faster than the most of my student collegues."

For this I build groups where I efficiently learned with my collgues in both studies.Nobody of my collegues thought it was possible to study both paralelly and it was a challange to me and to my intelligence that I wanted to accomplish. The motivation, the passion for both and the organization skills that I had, helped me to accomplish this mission succesfully. Not only that I had very good marks in both studies but I was also faster than my other collegues with the twice pressure. That raised the trust in my abilities."

My first meeting was very exiting, the project was very interesting, so I decided to start with the project directly after my masters study. The project was a success. I could solve a long lasting problem, where the problem with my previous data science colleagues could not solve and I putted 35 Networks in 1 compact and fast network. The solution was very elegant and the code is running very fast and stable, that what we wanted."
